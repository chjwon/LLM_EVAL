You will be given one description written for a meme.

Your task is to rate the summary on one metric.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.

Evaluation Criteria:

Coherence (1-5) - the collective quality of all sentences. We align this dimension with the DUC quality question of structure and coherence whereby "the summary should be well-structured and well-organized. The summary should not just be a heap of related information, but should build from sentence to a coherent body of information about a topic."

Evaluation Steps:

1. Read the entire meme description carefully.
2. Identify the main idea or theme conveyed by the meme.
3. Assess how well each sentence contributes to the overall theme.
4. Determine if the sentences are logically connected and if the ideas flow smoothly.
5. Evaluate the organization of the summary, checking if it builds coherently from the beginning to the end.
6. Assign a coherence rating from 1 to 5, based on the overall structure and logical flow of the information.
